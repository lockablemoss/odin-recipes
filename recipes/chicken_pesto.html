  <p>Chicken Pesto is a delicious dish that I always ask my mother to make. The basil, he oil, the garlic. It all comes together into a delicious dish that anyone can enjoy!</p>
  <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 1.3 lb. total)</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp pepper</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 pint grape tomatoes, slices in half</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup pesto</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Fillet the chicken breasts into two thinner pieces (or pound the chicken to an even thickness then cut each breast in half to create four portions). Season the chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook on each side until golden brown and cooked through (about 7-10 minutes total). Remove the chicken to a clean plate.</li>
      <li>Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the remaining olive oil to the skillet along with the minced garlic and halved grape tomatoes. Saut√© for about five minutes, or until the tomatoes start to soften and lose their shape.</li>
      <li>Add the heavy cream and pesto to the skillet with the tomatoes and stir to combine. Allow the sauce to come up to a simmer. Taste the sauce and adjust the salt or pepper to your liking.</li>
      <li>Add the chicken back to the skillet with the tomatoes and sauce, turning to coat the chicken. Allow the chicken to simmer in the sauce for just a few minutes more to heat through. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
